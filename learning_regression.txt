Regression is a statistical measure used in finance, investing and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other changing variables (known as independent variables). 

Consider a database as:

miles_travelled	num_deliveries	gas_price	travel_time
0   89	             4	          3.84	       7.0
1	66	             1			  3.19		   5.4
2	78				 3			  3.78	   	   6.6
3	111				 6		   	  3.89	       7.4
4	44	             1	          3.57	       4.8
5	77	             3		      3.57		   6.4
6	80				 3	          3.03	       7.0
7	66	  			 2		      3.51		   5.6
8	109				 5			  3.54		   7.3
9	76				 3			  3.25		   6.4

We need to determine the factors responsible for predicting the travel_time of a delivery person

1. Generate list of potential independent and dependent variables.
	dependent - travel_time
	independent- miles_travelled, num_deliveries, gas_price
	
2. Collect database

3. Check relationship between each independent variable and dependent variable using scatterplots and correltions.

4. Check relationship among independent variable using scatterplots and correltions

5. Conduct simple linear regression for each independent variable, dependent variable pair. (optional)
